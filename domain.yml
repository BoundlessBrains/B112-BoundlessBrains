  utter_periods:
  - text: No need to panic! Periods is a very common biological process in girls.
      A period happens because of changes in hormones in the body. Hormones give messages
      to the body. These hormones cause the lining of the uterus (or womb) to build
      up. This gets the uterus ready for an egg (from the mom) and sperm (from the
      dad) to attach and grow into a baby. If the woman does not get pregnant, the
      lining breaks down and bleeds. This same process happens every month. That is
      why most girls and women get their periods around once a month. Periods usually
      last about 5 days. But a period can be shorter or last longer according to your
      body metabolism.
